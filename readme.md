# Programming Abstractions in C++ (Stanford CS106B)

This repository contains my solutions and personal explorations of some exercises and projects from the book "Programming Abstractions in C++" by Eric S. Roberts, the offical textbook for Satnford's CS106B course.

**Offical Course Page:** [CS106B: Programming Abstractions](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/)

This collection serves as a public log of my journey through the book, documenting my progress in learning fundamental concepts of C++, data structures, and algorithms.


## About the Environment

The projects in this repository are developed using the **Stanford C++ Library** and require a specific version of **Qt Creator** as the IDE. This environment is provided by Stanford for the CS106B course and ensures that all library-specific features, particularly for graphics, work as intended.

## Getting Started

To compile and run these projects o n your own machine, you will need to set up the official Stanford CS106B development environment.

### 1. Prerequisite: Install the CS106B Qt Creator Package
The official package includes the necessary version of Qt Creator, the MinGW compiler, the debugger, and the pre-configured Stanford C++ libraries.

- **Download Link:** [Official Stanford CS106B Qt Creator Installation Page](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/resources/qt/)

Please follow the instructions for your operating system to install the complete package.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coskuncancoban/stanford-cs106b-abstractions
```

### 3. Open and Run a Specific Project
This repository is organized into folders by chapter. Each chapter folder may contains subfolders for individual projects or exercises.

1.  Navigate into a chapter folder (e.g., `functions_and_libraries`).
2.  Inside, choose a specific project folder (e.g., `yinyang`).
3.  Double-click the **`.pro`** file within that project's folder (e.g., `yinyang.pro`) to open it in the Stanford-provided Qt Creator.
4.  Click the green **"Run"** button (â–¶) in the bottom-left corner of Qt Creator to build and run the program.
